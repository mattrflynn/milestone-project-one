# **The Developers Website**

![Screen Shot 2019-05-15 at 21 57 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33867851/57809157-d40f9b80-775c-11e9-844f-7b61d9ac5d2a.png)

The Developers are an iconic 1960's rock band with over 50 years of music experience. 

After a long and succesful career spanning across the world, the bandmembers (Bob, Randy and Geoff) are ready to propel their music in to the modern age by digitalising their full back catalogue, releasing new music and showcasing footage from their concerts on a new website. Alongside this, they wish to make themselves available to play private functions through the booking system on their website. The Developers hope that their new website will help to further develop their growing social media presence so people continue rocking out to their music for years to come.

## UX

This site has been built for current fans of The Developers as well as people with lesser knowledge of the band that want to;
- explore their history through discovering their back catalogue
- watch videos of The Developers through their video archive
- read profiles of the band

## Testing

After thoroughly testing the website, I have been unable to find any flaws in its functionality. This has included the use of the use of booking forms with incorrectly entered forms - blank and incorrect email addresses. These tests have shown error messages meaning the user would be required to enter details correctly.

Thorough testing has also been conducted across the following devices:

- Samsung Galaxy S8 – Android 8.0
- Samsung Galaxy S6 – Android 7.0
- Samsung Galaxy S7 - Android 8.0
- Honor 8x - Android 8.1
- iPhone 8 – iOS 12.3
- iPhone 5 - iOS 12.1
- HP Laptop 15-bs0xx – Windows 10
- iPad Air 2 – iOS 12.3

Browser testing:
- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Microsoft edge

# Issues

I had an issue when launching the website on the iphone 5. The navbar is hiding elements of the content which meant the UX of using the website was affected slightly. Despite efforts to fix this issue, I was unable to do so.

I had an issue with aligning the text on the "about us" page . Although this is aligned where I would want it on the desktop, when viewing this through mobile (all mobiles inclusive) the lower text is slightly off centre.

### Validation

All files passed validation testing at https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea


# Deployment

My website is currently deployed on Github Pages - https://mattrflynn.github.io/milestone-project-one/

In order to deploy my website, I used Git hub pages. Once all files were saved to my repository, I utilised the setting function on GitHub and used "Git Hub Pages" and "master branch" which allowed me to publish my page at https://mattrflynn.github.io/milestone-project-one/
