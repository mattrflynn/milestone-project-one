The Developers are an iconic 1960's rock band with over 50 years of music experience. 

After a long and succesful career spanning across the world, the bandmembers (Bob, Randy and Geoff) are ready to propel their music in to the modern age by digitalising their full back catalogue, releasing new music and showcasing footage from their concerts on a new website. Alongside this, they wish to make themselves available to play private functions through the booking system on their website. The Developers hope that their new website will help to further develop their growing social media presence so people continue rocking out to their music for years to come.

## UX

This site has been built for current fans of The Developers as well as people with lesser knowledge of the band that want to;
- explore their history through discovering their back catalogue
- watch videos of The Developers through their video archive
- read profiles of the band

## User stories
User One wants to read the bands profiles so he can find out more about The Developers. By accessing the "About Us" link on the home page, he is taken to the About Us page where he can read about Bob, Randy & Geoff

User Two  wants to access the bands social media links so she can follow the bands Twitter updates. By scrolling to the bottom of the page, she is able to click the Twitter Icon and be taken to The Developers Twitter page.

User Three has been watching videos of the band and would now like to listen to some of the Developers Music. Using the Navigation bar at the top of the web page, He is able to click the "Our Music" link and access "The Developers" music from this page.

User Four is a long time fan of the developers and would like to book "The Developers" and would like to book the band for her wedding. From the home page, she can click the "Book Us" link to arrive at the booking page. From this page, the user is able to fill in her contact details and select dates for the booking.

User Five is accessing "The Developers" website from an iPhone. From the home page, he wants to book the band. From the drop down menu, he is able to click "book us" tab to navigate to the "book us" page and book "The Developers" for his event.

## Features Left to Implement
Social media feed - This would allow users to read reviews, comments and information being shared about "The Developers" via social media directly on the website.
Events calendar and ticket booking - This would allow users to assess up coming events and book tickets for gigs based on events

## Technologies Used
JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Bootstrap
The project uses Bootstrap to improve the layout through its grid system and to improve its functionality on mobile.

Font awesome
The project uses Font Awesome for the design of fonts and icons to improve its aesthetic appeal to users

## Testing

After thoroughly testing the website, I have been unable to find any flaws in its functionality. This has included the use of the use of booking forms with incorrectly entered forms - blank and incorrect email addresses. These tests have shown error messages meaning the user would be required to enter details correctly.

Thorough testing has also been conducted across the following devices:



In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

# Deployment

https://mattrflynn.github.io/milestone-project-one/

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
